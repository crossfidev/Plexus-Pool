# Mineplex

## Introduction

Mineplex is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Mineplex not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also comes to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade. For more information about
the project, see https://mineplex.io.

## Getting started

Instructions to
[install](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html), [start
using](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/introduction/howtouse.html), and
[taking part in the
consensus](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/introduction/howtorun.html) are
available at https://mineplex.gitlab.io/.

## The Mineplex software

This git repository contains the source code, the tests, and the
developer documentation of the Mineplex software running on the nodes of
the main Mineplex network and on [various Mineplex test
networks](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/introduction/test_networks.html).

The documentation for developers of the Mineplex software is available
online at https://mineplex.gitlab.io/. This documentation is always in
sync with the master branch which may however be slightly
desynchronized with the code running on the live networks.

The source code of Mineplex is placed under the [MIT Open Source
License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Contributing

### Development of the Mineplex protocol

The core of the Mineplex software that implements the economic ruleset is
called the *protocol*. The protocol can be updated through [Mineplex
on-chain voting
procedure](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/whitedoc/voting.html). Protocol
contributors are encouraged to synchronize their contributions to
minimize the number of protocol proposals that the stakeholders have
to study and to maximize the throughput of the voting procedure.

### Development of the Mineplex shell

Except for the protocol, all development of the Mineplex code happens on
GitLab at https://gitlab.com/mineplex/mineplex. Merge requests
(https://gitlab.com/mineplex/mineplex/-/merge_requests) should usually
target the `master` branch; see [the contribution
instructions](https://mineplex.gitlab.io/developer/contributing.html).
