# Mineplex

## Introduction

Mineplex is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Mineplex not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also comes to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade. For more information about
the project, see https://mineplex.io.
